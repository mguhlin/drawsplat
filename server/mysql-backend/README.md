# DrawSplatTM MySQL Backend (Phase 4)

Self-hosted Node.js + MySQL backend for districts that want a local database, real-time session enforcement, OAuth, SIS roster sync, and a parent portal. Pairs with the same static DrawSplatTM frontend as the Apps Script path.

> **Status:** scaffold built end-to-end (auth, OAuth, roster import, parent flow, time limits, SSE, retention cron, privacy packet, Clever connector). Has not yet been exercised against a live database in production. Run the integration test suite (TODO) before relying on it for a real district deployment.

## One-command deployment

```
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — at minimum change MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD, MYSQL_PASSWORD,
# DRAWSPLAT_PEPPER, GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, CORS_ORIGIN to real values.
docker compose up -d
```

That brings up MySQL 8.4 with `schema.sql` + `migrations/002_compliance.sql` + `migrations/003_freeze_and_polish.sql` applied on first boot, plus the Node API on port 8787 (override with `API_HOST_PORT`).

Sanity check:

```
curl http://localhost:8787/api/drawsplat/mysql/health
# {"ok":true,"provider":"mysql","time":"..."}
```

| GET  | `/admin/parent-requests` | district_admin, campus_admin, teacher | List parent tickets |
| GET / PUT | `/admin/compliance-config` | district_admin (PUT), district_admin/campus_admin (GET) | Read / write live config |

## Family Access Portal

`http://localhost:8787/parent-portal/parent-portal.html` (override `DRAWSPLAT_API_BASE` on `window` if the API is on another origin). Parents sign in with the one-time verification code their teacher issued; the portal then renders the student's account snapshot and any existing requests, and lets the parent submit additional requests.

## Migrating from Apps Script

```
node migrate-from-apps-script.mjs --src ./apps-script-export --dry-run
node migrate-from-apps-script.mjs --src ./apps-script-export
```

Drop the Sheet tabs into a folder as `Users.csv`, `ParentRequests.csv`, `Audit.csv`, `TimeUsage.csv`, plus an optional `boards/` directory of per-board JSON files. The CLI upserts everything into MySQL using the same schema.

## Compliance feature parity vs Apps Script

| Capability | Apps Script | MySQL |
|---|---|---|
| Text keyword filter (client + server enforcement) | ✅ | ✅ (server uses `safety.js`) |
| Link allow/blocklist | ✅ | ✅ |
| Board freeze | ✅ | ✅ (rooms.frozen, write rejected with 423) |
| Age band schema + lock + audit | ✅ | ✅ |
| Activity Records (audit log) | ✅ Sheet | ✅ `audit_events` table |
| Parent Request Center | ✅ Apps Script | ✅ Endpoints + parent portal HTML |
| Parent verification code | ✅ | ✅ |
| Data export | ✅ ZIP | ✅ JSON (turnins + user row); ZIP via privacy-packet for districts |
| Data deletion | ✅ | ✅ |
| Time-limit controls (UX + server gate) | ✅ poll | ✅ poll + **SSE push** |
| District Privacy Packet | ✅ | ✅ |
| Retention cleanup | ✅ Apps Script trigger | ✅ in-process cron |
| Compliance Console config | ✅ Script properties | ✅ `compliance_config` table |
| OAuth (Google + Microsoft) | Community only | ✅ |
| Roster CSV import | ⚠️ clunky | ✅ |
| SSO / SIS sync | ❌ | ✅ Clever connector |
| RBAC tree (district / campus / teacher / student / parent) | ⚠️ ad-hoc | ✅ enforced via `rbac.js` |
| Parent portal (read-only data view) | ⚠️ form only | ✅ HTML + endpoints |
| Real-time session enforcement | ❌ | ✅ SSE |
| Cross-device board sync | ❌ | ✅ SSE `board.updated` |

## Production checklist

- Serve the API over HTTPS (terminate TLS at a reverse proxy or use a managed PaaS).
- Set `CORS_ORIGIN` to your frontend domain.
- Rotate `DRAWSPLAT_PEPPER` only when you intend to invalidate every stored password.
- Run automated backups of the MySQL volume.
- Verify the Clever district token is stored as encrypted-at-rest (managed MySQL providers handle this; bare-metal installs need disk encryption).
- Hand the OAuth Google client ID to the frontend; the backend audience-checks it.
- For multi-instance deployments, set `DRAWSPLAT_CRON=0` on every instance except one, and front the SSE endpoint with a sticky-session load balancer (or swap `realtime.js` for Redis pub/sub).
